# eCommerce Computer Parts Shop Application


The store's home page should look like this:

### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

## Running the sample locally
Most of the site's functionality works with just the web application running. However, the site's Admin page relies on Blazor WebAssembly running in the browser, and it must communicate with the server using the site's PublicApi web application. You'll need to also run this project. You can configure Visual Studio to start multiple projects, or just go to the PublicApi folder in a terminal window and run `dotnet run` from there. After that from the Web folder you should run `dotnet run --launch-profile Web`. Now you should be able to browse to `https://localhost:5001/`. The admin part in Blazor is accessible to `https://localhost:5001/admin`  

Note that if you use this approach, you'll need to stop the application manually in order to build the solution (otherwise you'll get file locking errors).

After cloning or downloading the sample you must setup your database. 
To use the sample with a persistent database, you will need to run its Entity Framework Core migrations before you will be able to run the app.

You can also run the samples in Docker (see below).

### Configuring the sample to use SQL Server

1. By default, the project uses a real database. If you want an in memory database, you can add in the `appsettings.json` file in the Web folder

    ```json
   {
       "UseOnlyInMemoryDatabase": true
   }
    ```

1. Ensure your connection strings in `appsettings.json` point to a local SQL Server instance.
1. Ensure the tool EF was already installed. You can find some help [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet)

    ```
    dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
    ```

1. Open a command prompt in the Web folder and execute the following commands:

    ```
    dotnet restore
    dotnet tool restore
    dotnet ef database update -c catalogcontext -p ..\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data.csproj -s .\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Web.csproj
    dotnet ef database update -c appidentitydbcontext -p ..\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Identity\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Identity.csproj -s .\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Web.csproj

    dotnet ef migrations remove -s .\src\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data.csproj
 
    ```

    These commands will create two separate databases, one for the store's catalog data and shopping cart information, and one for the app's user credentials and identity data.

1. Run the application.

    The first time you run the application, it will seed both databases with data such that you should see products in the store, and you should be able to log in using the demouser@microsoft.com account.

    Note: If you need to create migrations, you can use these commands:

    ```
    -- create migration (from Web folder CLI)
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialDataModel --context catalogcontext -p ..\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Data.csproj -s .\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Web.csproj -o Migrations
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialIdentityModel --context appidentitydbcontext -p ..\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Identity\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Identity.csproj -s .\eCommerce.ComputerParts.Shop.Web.csproj -o Migrations
    
    ```

## Running the sample in the dev container

This project includes a `.devcontainer` folder with a [dev container configuration](https://containers.dev/), which lets you use a container as a full-featured dev environment.

You can use the dev container to build and run the app without needing to install any of its tools locally! You can work in GitHub Codespaces or the VS Code Dev Containers extension.

Learn more about using the dev container in its [readme](/.devcontainer/devcontainerreadme.md).

## Running the sample using Docker

You can run the Web sample by running these commands from the root folder (where the .sln file is located):

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to make requests to localhost:5106 for the Web project, and localhost:5200 for the Public API project once these commands complete. If you have any problems, especially with login, try from a new guest or incognito browser instance.

You can also run the applications by using the instructions located in their `Dockerfile` file in the root of each project. Again, run these commands from the root of the solution (where the .sln file is located).
